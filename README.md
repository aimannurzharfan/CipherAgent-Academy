> **"Mission: Secure the Line. Decode the Message. Defeat the Hacker."**

**CipherAgent Academy** is an interactive cryptography learning platform designed to train aspiring operatives in the art of secure communication. Unlike traditional textbooks, agents learn by doing—executing tactical simulations to master encryption algorithms, key exchange protocols, and network defense.

## Mission Briefing

Navigate the global network via the **Mission Map** to unlock and execute your training operations.

### Mission 1: The Rail Fence Cipher (Transposition)
* **Objective:** Decrypt intercepted messages by mastering transposition patterns.
* **Mechanics:** A "Click-to-Teleport" puzzle where agents reconstruct scrambled data on a Zig-Zag rail grid.
* **Key Concept:** Transposition Ciphers & Data Obfuscation.

### Mission 2: The Diffie-Hellman Handshake
* **Objective:** Establish a secure line with HQ over a compromised public channel.
* **Mechanics:** An interactive "Color Lab" wizard. Agents mix public and private "paint" colors to generate a shared secret key without ever revealing their private components.
* **Key Concept:** Public Key Cryptography & Shared Secret Derivation.

### Mission 3: The Interception (MITM Defense)
* **Objective:** Defend the network against a "Man-in-the-Middle" attack.
* **Mechanics:** A fast-paced firewall defense game. Agents must identify and neutralize "Red Bug" packets (Hackers) attempting to hijack the key exchange between Alice and Bob.
* **Key Concept:** Network Security, Authentication, & Active Defense.

### CyberTutor (Tactical Advisor)
Your personal field handler, powered by **First Order Logic**.
* **Context-Aware:** Monitors your mission progress in real-time.
* **Tactical Support:** If you fail a puzzle or struggle with a concept, the Advisor automatically pushes relevant hints and "Briefing Cards" to your HUD.
* **Offline Capable:** Fully functional without external API dependencies.

## Tech Stack

* **Core:** React 19 (Vite)
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS (Custom "Cyberpunk" Design System)
* **Animations:** Framer Motion (Fluid drag-and-drop & transition effects)
* **Logic:** Custom JavaScript implementations of cryptographic algorithms.
